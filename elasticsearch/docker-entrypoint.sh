  # The virtual file /proc/self/cgroup should list the current cgroup

  # introspect the statistics for the cgroup for the given
  # hierarchy. Alas, Docker breaks this by mounting the container
  # statistics at the root while leaving the cgroup paths as the actual
  # paths. Therefore, Elasticsearch provides a mechanism to override
  # reading the cgroup path from /proc/self/cgroup and instead uses the
  # cgroup path defined the JVM system property
  # es.cgroups.hierarchy.override. Therefore, we set this value here so
  # that cgroup statistics are available for the container this process
  # will run in.
